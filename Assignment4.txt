EMPLOYEE CLASS:
Here we declare all variables 
we have implemented toString()
because without it we can't get the value of Object.
If we won't declare ToString() then we will get only the hascode value of
the objects.
APP CLASS:
Here we call service.FindAll() in SOP statement.It will go to the 
findAll() method in EmployeeRepositaryImpl Class.
here we have created a List of Eployee class .
we have created the reference of List<Employee> 
By the help of PreparedStatement we have written SELECT_ALL queries
through thr con.prepareStatement();
we used here SELECT statement then we have to write executequery()
ResultSet contains the result of an executing Query
THen we created while loop to check is there any next element then
create the object of employee class and assigned it as ref.variablename
=getInt("Column name in the table");
then we added to the employee class.
we have declared every method of EmployeeRepositaryImpl class in the 
IEmployeeRepositary Interface.It's the beauty of interface ..
IN service Class we are connected to the DATABASE .we call the save
method here ..It will help to know the Employee Status as we printed here
emp.id.currently number of Employee added in the databse we can see here
we also added roll back() which will help undo the datas  of the database.
we also connect the List<employee> to the database in service class
And in connection class we gave user name password and url to connect to
the database.And in EmployeeQueries class we wrote two Queries
One for Inserting tha datas and one foe retriving the data by chhosing
INSERT and SELECT statement Respectively
